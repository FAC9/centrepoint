## User testing

### Conducting the tests

#### Introduction
We have built an app to allow former residents of Centrepoint to make requests for information and documents that will help them after they have moved on from Centrepoint accommodation.  

We’d like you to imagine that you have received an email saying that a new request has arrived from a former resident, so you need to log in and see what it is. In addition, you will shortly be going on holiday and you would like to add another staff member as an admin.  

#### Admin questions before the test
- Have you had to deal with informations requests from former residents in the course of your work?
  - Were you able to verify the identity of the person making the request?
  - How long did it take you complete the response?
  - Were there implications for the person making the request if there was a delay in getting the information or verifying their identity?
- Do you have a Yoti set up?
- Did you have any problems getting Yoti set up?
- What type of phone are you using?
- Are you likely to be processing this sort of request in your work?
- Do you have access to In-Form?

#### Instructions for the test
- Talk us through what you’re doing
- Share your thought process with us and any reflections as you go
- There are no wrong or right answers

#### If there are issues during the test
- Is that what you think you would do? So what would you do next?
- Identify where people are confused

#### After completion - admin
- Were you able to log in and view the dashboard?
- Were you able to open specific requests and view the contents?
- Were you able to close requests and open others?
- Were you able to mark requests as completed and vice versa?
- What were the best and worst things about the app?
- Was there anything that you think is missing or incomplete?
- Any thoughts, feelings or other feedback not covered?

### Observations
- For each test we should have one person conducting the test and the other observing.
- The notes below are for our use and should not be shared with testers so as not to bias their responses

##### Admin journey
- Is it clear that they log in the same way as other users and because they are admins, they will be diverted to the dashboard instead of being directed to the request form?
- Are admins clear about what they can and can't do in the dashboard?
- Were the admins able to add another admin?
- Are there any pain points? Is anything unclear?
- Does the interface inspire confidence?
- Can they log out?
