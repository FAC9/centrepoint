## User testing: ex-resident

### Conducting the tests

#### Introduction
We have built an app to allow former residents of Centrepoint to make requests for information and documents that will help them after they have moved on from Centrepoint accommodation.  

We’d like you to imagine that you have applied for a rental property and you need your accommodation history, a rental arrears report, a rental reference or some other piece of information that will help you in your application.  

#### Ex-resident questions before the test
- Are you signed up to the Point?
- Have you found it useful?
- Are there any features that you would like added to the Point?
- Have you ever requested this kind of information from Centrepoint or any other organisation?
- Were you able to get the information you needed?
- How long did it take for you to receive the information?
- Do you have a Yoti set up?
- Did you have any problems getting Yoti set up?
- What type of phone are you using?
- What information would you like to request?
- If you were making this kind of request, would you be likely to use a mobile or desktop computer?
- How would you like to be contacted by Centrepoint?

#### Instructions for the tests
- Talk us through what you’re doing
- Share your thought process with us and any reflections as you go
- There are no wrong or right answers

#### If there are issues or questions during the test
- Is that what you think you would do? So what would you do next?
- Identify where people are confused

#### After completion - ex-residents
- Were you able to complete your task?
- If you were not able to complete your task, how would you resolve the issue?
- Are you confident that Centrepoint received your request for information?
- When do you expect to hear back from Centrepoint?
- Is this an acceptable time frame for the response?
- What were the best and worst things about the app?
- Any thoughts, feelings or other feedback not covered?

### Observations
- For each test we should have one person conductin the test and the other observing.
- The notes below are for our use and should not be shared with testers so as not to bias their responses

##### Ex-resident journey
- Is there a clear call to action on the landing page?
- Is there a clear journey through the app?
- If they have trouble with Yoti, can they get help? Is Yoti too much of a barrier?
  (Potential implications for architecture - perhaps Yoti should be a means of identifying the user after the request has been made?)
- How likely are they to give up without managing to log in and make a request?
- Is it clear whether they have been successful in submitting a request?
- Is it clear when they should expect to hear back?
- Can they log out?
- Are there any pain points? Is anything unclear?
- Does the interface inspire confidence?
